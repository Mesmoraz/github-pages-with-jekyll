I'm making a blog about my development journey. I started my journey in software and game development in 2007. I created a 2D rpg playable 
game as my senior project. I attended community college through a public program called, Running Start - this program allows students to attend 
community college courses in lieu of high school courses. 

I took as many programming courses as I possibly could and ended up with my associated in Business Integrated Technology. This program taught me
data structures, HTML, CSS, C#, Java and Javascript. We mostly focused on logical processes and never created anything substantial to put into
a portfolio. 

I attended a videogame programming college following my High School graduation and as a tangent, if I may - High School students are in no 
way able to decide that they are ready to commit to college. Private colleges are a scam. Now if I had the learning capability and future predicting
ability of an adult at the time of attending this private college for game development, I think I would be quite successful. Do I want -nay- 
_am I able to_ spend close to 100,000s of dollars in order to get a job doing the labor that I find MOST enjoyable and that I'm good at? 
Unless, my family decided that education was important from my birth, which a 19 year old mother did not, I was placed in a precarious situation. 

Anyway, I attended this college for a semester. I was a young male who had just discovered he was gay no more than 4 months prior. I was so excited
to have a college expeirence flirting with boys and learning more about social enviornments and exploring the drama - growing emotionally. All the fun
things that you do at a Liberal Arts University campus. Now, Professor Mead (Daddy) [I'm so sorry if you find this Prof. Mead] said one day a classic
"Look to your left look to your right 2 of you won't be here in 4 years". God, how I wanted to prove him wrong that I would be the black sheep
that stayed. It was clear I wasn't going to make it. I found social relationships way more important at this point than my future career. I was
smart enough to make friends with the smart kids, who tended to be older. I guess they were adults.

During my game design class, the professor who was so special because he worked at Nintendo - critiqued my team's first game and never offerred praise. 
Never guided us to think more deeply - never explained what it meant to design my f***ing platforms with math. You want me to use OOP in the placement
of my platforms as the first project? I get the idea now, I just needed some help. [tbc...]

Alas, this 5 minute blog session is coming to a close and I suppose this is an introduction of sorts to why I'm here. I am somebody
